            <p>
              Welcome to my "Portfolio in Progress." I am a coffee professional by day, currently taking a Coding Bootcamp through the University of Washington with the intention of changing career paths. This is my second homework assignment for UW Coding Bootcamp and while I have yet to complete any personal projects to include within such a page I would love to introduce you to some of my favorite coffee shops from my hometown, Seattle.

              <p>A cozy spot located in the Central District neighborhood Union Coffee has an amazing lineup of coffees from world-class roasters, and are especially focused on roasters who are ethically minded and actively making the coffee community and industry better. They also boast a wonderful selection of wine organized and operatied by Juice Club and are a true focal point of the neighborhood (in my opinion). </p>

              <p>Translating to "Coffee Coffee Coffee" Boon Boona is an amazing coffee roaster with two cafe locations between Seattle and Renton.
